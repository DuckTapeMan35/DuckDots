.bashrc makes it so fastfetch is used when starting a terminal and so that yazi opened with `y` exits on the directory that you were in when you quit it.

kitty.conf makes your terminal transparent (requires picom) changes the colors to the ones generated by pywal and changes the font used.

## dependencies
-kitty
-terminus font

```bash
yay -S terminus-ttf-font kitty fish
```

## what to do

1. substitute your config.fish file
2. substitute your kitty.conf (located at ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf) file for the provided one
