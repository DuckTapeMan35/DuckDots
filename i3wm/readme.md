This is the main config file for i3wm, it requires that you also install some dependencies and setup the scripts to work correctly.

## dependencies

- all of the dependencies mentioned in the scripts folder
- nvim
- pywalfox
- flameshot
- librewolf
- yazi
- rofi

```bash
yay -S nvim flameshot librewolf yazi rofi
```
 refer to scripts and browser folders for the rest of the dependencies.
 technically speaking it also depends on https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes but this is covered on the polaybar_an_rofi folder
 
## what to do with this file

1. drop it in ~/.config/i3
2. complete the steps in the scripts and polybar_and_rofi folders
