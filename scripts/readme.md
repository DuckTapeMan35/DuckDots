## dependencies

- picom
- pywal-discord
- polybar
- polychromatic-cli
- dunst
- pywal

  ```bash
  yay -S picom pywal-discord polybar polychromatic-cli openrazer-daemon dunst pywal
  ```
## what to do with these

1. start/enable the openrazer daemon
2. put the scripts under ~/.config/scripts

## notes
for some reason using ~ instead of $HOME wasn't working for dunst and colors.json. I am but a humble servant of bash so I will not question it and move on with my life
