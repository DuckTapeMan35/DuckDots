my dotfiles: an idiot's attempt at computering


## Structure
You see, I'm dumb af and will forget how all of this works in 2 days so this has to be structured in such a way that a 5 year old can understand.

Simply open any folder and there will be instructions on how to set that part up in the readme.

##dependencies that won't be mentioned anywhere else
these dependencies are overarching so they go here.

- pywal
- kitty

```bash
yay -S python-pywal kitty
```
