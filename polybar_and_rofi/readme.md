The confiduration for rofi is taken directly from https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes and it will work by simply installing it, however I made some slight modifications and added a window-switcher.rasi

## what to do
1. install the polybar themes from the provided link
2. remove everything except for the hack theme (optional)
3. substitute the files on ~/.config/polybar/hack by the ones provided and add window-switcher.rasi
