I adapted the theme from https://github.com/chakibchemso/discord-tui to work with pywal-discord.

## dependencies

- pywal-discord
- vesktop

```bash
yay -S pywal-discord-git vesktop-bin
```

## what to do
Drop pywal-disccord-duck.css under /usr/share/pywal-discord

## notes
First things first, discord's new UI broke themes so for this to work you need to disable it with a vesktop plugin.

This is is also kinda heavy so If your computer isn't very good skip this and remove the lines pertaining to pywal-discord from the scripts or typing in discord won't be very responsive.

No matter what I do I couldn't get typing/deleting a lot of characters when holding down a key to be responsive.
